= EJB Thread Pool
:ordinal: 1

The EJB Thread Pool is for prepared EJB beans which are ready for usage, this means there is no instantiation and initialization overhead when the bean is used. It can also be used to limit the number of concurrent beans in use.

An individual bean can specify a configuration that overrides the configuration of the EJB container in the `<bean-pool>` element of the `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` file.

=== Using the Admin Console
To configure the EJB thread pool using the admin console, go to Configuration → [instance-configuration] → EJB Container and scroll down to see `Additional Properties`.

Add a new additional property, set the Name to the property name from the table above of the property you want to set, and set the Value to a valid value for that property.

=== Using the Asadmin CLI
To configure the EJB thread pool with the asadmin CLI, execute the following set command, replacing the configName with the name of your configuration, the property name with a property name from the table above and a valid value for that property.

[source, shell]
