This command can be used to start a specified instance of Payara, but only when it corresponds to a local instance. A local instance is located in the same host from where the `asadmin` command is executed. This command is executed in "local" mode, which means that the DAS is not started in order to effectively execute it. Keep in mind that running the instance using the `sync` option has some nuances, so read the note below for more information.

[[command-options-3]]
=== Command Options

NOTE: These are not the same as the options available for the `start-instance` command.

[cols="1,1,4,1,1a",options="header",]
|====
|Option |Type |Description |Default |Mandatory

== `generate-bash-autocomplete`

*Usage*::
`asadmin >generate-bash-autocomplete output_file`

*Aim*::
Creates an asadmin autocompletion script for bash.

The created file will be located in the server's host and not the client. If they are on different hosts, then the file will be needed to copied from the server to the client.
TIP: You can add the resulting file to your bash path by adding `source path/to/outputfile` to your `.bashrc` settings or copy the file into the `/etc/bash_completion.d` directory.

This means that you can run asadmin commands by typing `asadmin` in a terminal and you can use double-tab to autocomplete a command, similar to other bash commands.

=== Command Options

|===
|Option | Type | Description | Default | Mandatory
| `--force`| `Boolean`| Whether to overwrite a script file if one already exists| `false`| No

[[create-service]]
== `create-service`

*Usage*::
`asadmin> create-service <options> <domain-or-instance-name>`

*Aim*::
Configures the starting of a DAS or a Payara Server instance on an unattended boot.

The create-service subcommand configures the starting of a domain administration server (DAS) or a Payara Server instance on an unattended boot on Windows, Linux, and Oracle Solaris systems.

If no operand is specified and the domains directory contains only one domain, the subcommand configures the starting of the DAS for the default domain. If no operand is specified and the domains directory contains multiple domains, an error occurs.

If the operand specifies an instance, the create-service subcommand does not contact the domain administration server (DAS) to determine the node on which the instance resides. To determine the node on which the instance resides, the subcommand searches the directory that contains the node directories. If multiple node directories exist, the node must be specified as an option of the subcommand.

The subcommand contains internal logic to determine whether the supplied operand is a DAS or an instance.

This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

[[create-service-windows-os]]
=== Behaviour of `create-service` on Windows Systems

On Windows systems, this subcommand must be run as the OS-level administrator user and requires the Microsoft .NET Framework (http://www.microsoft.com/net/), otherwise, the subcommand fails. It creates a Windows service to represent the DAS or instance. The service is created in the disabled state. After this subcommand creates the service, you must use the Windows Services Manager or the Windows Services Wrapper to start, stop, uninstall, or install the service.

The subcommand creates the following Windows Services wrapper files for the service in the `domain-dir\bin` directory or the `instance-dir\bin` directory:

* Configuration file: `service-nameService.xml`
* Executable file: `service-nameService.exe`

[[create-service-linux-os]]
=== Behaviour of `create-service` on Linux Systems

On Linux systems, the create-service subcommand first detects **System-V** or **SystemD** init systems.

On systems using System-V, it creates an initialization script `/etc/init.d/payara_domain-or-instance-name` and installs a link to this script in the `/etc/rc?.d` directories. After this subcommand creates the script, you must use this script to start, stop, or restart the domain or instance.

On systems using SystemD, the subcommand creates a configuration file `payara_domainname.service` in `/etc/systemd/system`. It is recommended to specify non-root user to run payara (parameter `--serviceuser`). It is possible to further configure the service via `--serviceproperties`.

On Linux systems, this subcommand must be run as the OS-level root user, because it writes to system directories.

[[create-service-solaris-os]]
=== Behavior of `create-service` on Oracle Solaris Systems

On Oracle Solaris systems, the create-service subcommand creates a Service Management Facility (SMF) service to represent the DAS or instance. The service is created in the disabled state. After this subcommand creates the service, you must use SMF commands to start, enable, disable, delete, or stop the service. For more information about SMF, see the following documentation for the Oracle Solaris operating system:

* "Managing Services (Overview)" in System Administration Guide: Basic Administration
* "Managing Services (Tasks)" in System Administration Guide: Basic Administration

On Oracle Solaris systems, this subcommand must be run as the OS-level user with superuser privileges. The configuration file for the DAS or instance must be stored in a directory to which the superuser has access and cannot be stored on a network file system. The service that is created is controlled by the OS-level user who owns the directory where the configuration of the DAS or instance resides.

On Oracle Solaris systems, the manifest file is created in the following directory by default:

----
/var/svc/manifest/application/GlassFish/domain-or-instance-name_domain-or-instance-root-dir
----

IMPORTANT: To run this subcommand, you must have `solaris.smf.*` authorization. 

To run these commands as non-root user, the system administrator must be contacted so that the relevant authorizations are granted. You must also ensure that the following conditions are met:

* Oracle Solaris 10 administration commands such as `svccfg(1M)`, `svcs(1)`, and `auths(1)` are available through the PATH statement, so that these commands can be executed. A simple test to do so is to run the command which `svccfg` in the shell.
* You must have write permission for the path `/var/svc/manifest/application/GlassFish`. Usually, the superuser has write permission to this path.

If you delete a service that you created by using the create-service subcommand, you must delete the directory that contains the manifest file and the entire contents of the directory. Otherwise, an attempt to re-create the service by using the create-service subcommand fails. The Oracle Solaris command `svccfg` does not delete this directory.

[[delete-service]]
== `_delete-service`

*Usage*::
`asadmin> _delete-service <options> <domain-or-instance-name>`

*Aim*::
The _delete-service subcommand deletes scripts created by the subcommand create-service.

If no operand is specified and the domains directory contains only one domain, the subcommand deletes the script that starts the DAS for the default domain. If no operand is specified and the `domains` directory contains multiple domains, an error occurs.

The subcommand contains internal logic to determine whether the supplied operand is a DAS or an instance.

This subcommand is supported in local mode only.
