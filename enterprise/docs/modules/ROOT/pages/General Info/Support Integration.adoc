When you click on the button to create a ticket, you will be greeted with the ticket creation menu. There are fields for the following:

====
Required fields are followed by an asterisk (*).
====

* Subject* - a brief summary of the ticket, or it's topic.
* Description* - A more detailed description of the ticket. Here you will explain the problem with as much detail as you can.
* Type [Question/Incident/Problem/Task] - This is the category of the ticket.
For example, a question would be for when there is something which you don't know how to do, but isn't a bug with Payara Server itself.
* Environment* - Is the server being used in production or for development?
* Priority* - Is a button displaying slightly strangely or is the server throwing ugly exceptions left right and Centre?
* Payara Version* - The version of Payara which this ticket relates to.

[[attachments]]
==== Attachments

You can attach relevant files to the ticket. For example, if it's a configuration issue or question, you may want to attach the domain log. You can always attach them later if they're asked for. Just click on one of the buttons and the correct file will automatically be created (if applicable) and uploaded.

You can also edit an attached *domain.xml*. You would do this, for example, if there is context sensitive data that needs to be obfuscated.
