= Backup and Restore Upgrade Method
:ordinal: 1

You will need to download the version of Payara Community you are planning to upgrade to before beginning the backup and restore method of upgrading Payara. The latest version of Payara Community is recommended.

== Backup a Payara Server Domain
NOTE: To create a domain backup, that domain must be stopped.

To create a backup of a domain, the asadmin `backup-domain` command is used:
[source, shell]
----
asadmin backup-domain {domain_name}
----

The resulting ZIP file will be saved in a destination with this structure:

`{backupDir}/{domain_name}/<domain-name>_<YYYY_MM_DD>_v<backup-number>`

Where the backup number is a consecutive integer representing how many backups of the domain have been made.

You can get additional details of the backup operation by using the `--long` argument when running the command, which will output the following data:

[source, text]
----
asadmin> backup-domain --backupDir /home/james/payarabackup --long domain1

Backed up domain1 at Tue Jul 05 13:48:54 BST 2022.

== Restore a Payara Server Domain
IMPORTANT: Since instances are stored separately from a domain, and they may be on remote hosts, the command will have no effect on restoring instance data.

To restore from a backup, the asadmin `restore-domain` command is used:
[source, shell]
----
asadmin restore-domain --filename {path_to_backup} {domain_name}
----

You can get additional details of the restore operation by using the `--long` argument when running the command, which will output the following data:

[source, text]
----
asadmin> restore-domain --filename /home/james/payarabackup/domain1/domain1_2022_07_04_v00001.zip --long domain1

Restored the domain (domain1) to /home/james/5.2022.2/payara5/glassfish/domains/domain1

== Restoring an Instance
Since all data in an instance directory is kept in sync with the DAS, there is no added data (besides logs, caches and some MQ data when a file-based store is used) and an instance can be completely restored simply by making sure there is an empty directory with the name of the instance inside a node folder of the correct name.

For example:
`payara5/glassfish/nodes/localhost-example/myInstance`

Running the `start-local-instance` command with the `sync` property set to `full` sync, will restore the instance completely:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> start-local-instance --sync=full myInstance
----

== Considerations for OpenMQ
If OpenMQ (Payara Server’s JMS broker) is being used, the default configuration is to use EMBEDDED mode, meaning that Payara Server will fully manage the JMS broker within the same JVM as the server instance and a file-based store is used for persistent messages.

The alternative option of LOCAL allows for the use of an “enhanced” broker cluster, whereby the JMS broker instances are started as separate JVMs and use a database connection for storage. Assuming the database is highly available, this completely avoids any danger when needing to use --sync=full on the instance.
